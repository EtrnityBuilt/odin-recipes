        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <h3>For the Salad</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 slices white or wheat bread, crusts removed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, chopped</li>
            <li>3 large eggs </li>
            <li>1 large head romaine lettuce, washed, patted dry</li>
            <li>4 to 5 tablespoons Caesar dressing </li>
            <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Caesar Dressing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 anchovies, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard </li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, pressed or finely chopped</li>
            <li>3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white wine vinegar, or lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <h3>Make the Salad</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Put the bread into 1/2-inch (1.27-centimeter) cubes. Heat 2 tablespoons neutral oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Gently fry the bread for about 4 to 5 minutes, turning occasionally, until crisp and golden. Remove bread with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Fry the bacon in the same pan over medium-low heat until crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, boil 3 eggs starting in cold water. Once the water reaches a rolling boil, boil for 3 minutes for soft-boiled and 6 minutes for hard boiled. Remove from water and rinse under cold water until cool enough to handle. Peel and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Make the Dressing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place 2 egg yolks, chopped anchovies, mustard, and garlic in a large mixing bowl. Whisk vigorously to combine ingredients. Slowly add the oil a few drops at a time, while continuing to whisk vigorously. The mixture will thicken.</li>
            <li>Add the vinegar or lemon juice and whisk again. The dressing should have the consistency of whipping cream. If it is too thick, add a teaspoon of warm water and whisked rinse under cold water until cool enough to handle. Peel and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assemble the Salad</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Roughly but evenly chop the lettuce and place in a large mixing bowl. Add 4 to 5 tablespoons of the dressing and toss well to coat the lettuce. Add the croutons and bacon and toss again. Cut the boiled eggs into quarters.</li>
            <li>Divide salad into 4 serving bowls and top with boiled egg quarters. Grate on some Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
