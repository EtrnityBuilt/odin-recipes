/# odin-recipes
This is a project to create an HTML recipe website for the 'Recipes' lesson in the The Odin Project's Foundations course (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes). Created 9/3/2022, Ben Bootsma.

By the end of this project I will have:
1. Created a repo on Github.com
2. Cloned the repo to my local machine
3. Updated the README.md file
4. Created an index page with hyperlinks to recipes
5. Created ordered (numbered) and unordered (dot point) lists on webpages
